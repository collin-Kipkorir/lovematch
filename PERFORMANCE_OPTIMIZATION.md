# Performance Optimization Guide

This guide provides instructions for optimizing the performance of the ProfileCard component and profile loading in the Home page:

1. First, install and import the new optimized ProfileCard:
```bash
mv ProfileCard.tsx ProfileCardOriginal.tsx
```

2. Use the new optimized version we created in ProfileCardOptimized.tsx

3. Key optimizations implemented:

## ProfileCard Optimizations:
- Debounced like/message buttons to prevent rapid clicks
- Memoized component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Image loading optimizations with lazy loading and proper fetchpriority
- Loading states to provide feedback during actions
- Optimized callback functions with useCallback

## Home Page Optimizations:
- Implemented infinite scrolling with IntersectionObserver
- Lazy loading of profile cards with proper Suspense boundaries
- Loading placeholders during profile fetching
- Optimized list rendering with proper keys and memoization
- Progressive image loading strategy

4. Monitor the performance improvements using:
```javascript
// Add this in development to profile rendering
console.time('ProfileCard render');
// ...
console.timeEnd('ProfileCard render');
```

5. Additional recommendations:
- Implement proper database indexing
- Add caching layer with Redis or similar
- Use CDN for profile images
- Implement virtualization for long lists
- Add proper error boundaries
